# This file shall contain the complete list of Ninja Boards, their numeric ID and the corresponding Voltage level to sense that ID
# This voltage level is the primary determinant of the ID- it can of course be realised in an unlimited number of R combos
# My inital thought is that it makes sense to standardise (make constant) one of the values, so that it's always Rc/Rid

# Special IDs : 0V and 5V should be reserved.  0V means nothing is plugged in, and 5V is ignored, but prolly means a problem that can be flagged to the User
# In terms of reserving these IDs, I think a sensible approach will be to divide and conquer, so that we don't need to be too picky about values.

# NOTE: The 'show your work' part of this is in a .numbers file.  What is provided here is the result of that work.

# Here's the thinking, one more time, from the top:

# 1. The upper limit on sense ability is 1024 values.
# 2. There will be an absolute upper limit of IDs of 256.
# 3. IDs will be allocated on a divide and conquer basis

ID, Volts, Name
0,0,RESERVED- No Board Connected
128,
255,5,RESERVED- Some Weird Problem
