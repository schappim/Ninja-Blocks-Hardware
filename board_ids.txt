# Document : board_ids.txt
# Author   : Justy

# This file shall contain the complete list of Ninja Boards, their numeric ID and the corresponding Voltage level to sense that ID
# This voltage level is the primary determinant of the ID- it can of course be realised in an unlimited number of R combos
# My inital thought is that it makes sense to standardise (make constant) one of the values, so that it's always Rc/Rid

# Special IDs : 0V and 5V should be reserved.  0V means nothing is plugged in, and 5V is ignored, but prolly means a problem that can be flagged to the User
# In terms of reserving these IDs, I think a sensible approach will be to divide and conquer, so that we don't need to be too picky about values.

# Having said this, it would be nice to establish if a resolution of 256 ids is easily achievable with standard, cheap, 5% tolerance resistors.

# From this point on, this file is a lovely CSV
